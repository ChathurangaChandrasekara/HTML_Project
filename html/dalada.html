						<h2> Dalada Museum </h2>
						<p> The latest institution added to the Dalada Shrine is the “Sri Dalada Museum”.Ever since the Tooth Relic shrine was established in Kandy, different grades of visitors and devotees, 
						ranging from the Royalty and Heads of States to the poorest of the general public,have been offering various gifts to the Sacred Tooth Relic, and these were preciously protected in specially built store-rooms by the successive line of DiyawadanaNilames.
						<br> The Dalada Museum is located on the first and the second floors of the new wing called the AluthMaligawa set up by one of the past DiyawadanaNilames, T.B.Nugawela.The display on the first floor consists of historical records from the time when the Tooth 
						Relic was brought to Sri Lanka to the time of the British rule, the 1765 Dutch Plan of the Palace Complex, Lists of the Chief Prelates of the two monastic 
						establishments of Malwatte and Asgiriya, who were responsible for the protection of the Tooth Relic, Lists of Kandyan kings, the portrait busts and lists of the 
						long line of DiyawadanaNilames, the Royal garments of king Kirti Sri Rajasimha, the Pingo used by the king in the Buddha-puja service, and the most recent discoveries of mural remains that were exposed due to the bomb blast caused by 
						Tamil Tigers in January 1998.The photographic display includes some of the most important sites where the Tooth Relic was enshrined through centuries and a large array of pictures depicting the immeasurable damage caused to the DaladaMaligava due to the bomb blast. 
						<br>Among the items on view on the second floor are historical artifacts used in the daily ritual ceremonies of the Tooth Relic shrine, caskets, Buddha statues and typical Kandyan gold and silver jewellery studded with precious gem stones, all donated by the devotees. 
						Also on view on this floor are special exhibits of great historical and religious value.These include(a) the silver water pot offered by king Kirti Sri Rajasimha, (b) Silver hanging lamp offered by king RajadhiRajasimha, (c) the painted replica of Buddha’s 
						Footprint sent by king BoromKot of Thailand when he sent some monks to establish the Higher Ordination on Sinhala monks headed by Venerable WalivitaSaranankara (who became Sangharaja subsequently), (d) the unique Relic Casket containing bodily relics of the great 
						TheraMoggliputta who headed The Third Dhamma Council held by Emperor Asoka in the 3rd Century BC, etc. Other significant exhibits include ancient flags, coins, carved ivory tusks donated by Burma, commemorative carved plaques etc.
						A visit to this grandest display would evidently provide an insight into the splendor that was Kandyan Heritage, her Culture and the Arts.</p>

							<p> According to legend, the tooth was taken from the Buddha as he lay on his funeral pyre. It was smuggled to Sri Lanka in 313 AD, hidden in 
							the hair of Princess Hemamali who fled the Hindu armies besieging her father's kingdom in India.</p>
							
						<p> It immediately became an object of great reverence and was enshrined in a series of nested jeweled reliquaries. The tooth was brought out 
							for special occasions and paraded on the backs of elephants, which are sacred to the Buddha. where it survived numerous attempts to capture and destroy it.</p>
							
						<p> When the capital was moved to Kandy, the tooth was taken to the new city and placed in temples built to honor it. The temple was originally 
							built under Kandyan kings between 1687 and 1707, but later severely damaged during the 18th-century colonial wars against the Portugese 
							and Dutch. After the wars, the original wooden structures were restored in stone.</p>
							
						<p> In January 1998 Hindu Tamil separatists bombed the temple, damaging its facade and roof. Restoration began immediately afterward.</p>
