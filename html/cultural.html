                  	<p> Kandy has become the foremost cultural city of Sri Lanka due to a rich heritage of living monument. Not only is it 
							home to a multitude of Buddhist religious monuments, but it plays center stage for over 600 years of recorded local history. According to historical 
							records the city of Kandy was first established, under the name &#8220;Senkadagalapura,&#8221; by King Wicramabahu the III during his reign, amid 1357-1374 AD. The 
							city was said to have been established in Watapuluwa, north of the modern city center, according to historical scholars. The present name of the 
							city, &#8220;Kandy&#8221; originated during the Colonial Era. It was during the 15th century, 1473-1581 AD, that King Senasammata Wickrembahu 
							designated Kandy as the capital of the Kandyan Kingdom which was based in the hill country in the central parts of the Island. Three generations 
							of kings ruled the kingdom from Kandy there on forth. It was under the reign of King Wimaladarmasuriya the I, that the Sacred Tooth Relic of 
							the Lord Buddha was bought to Kandy and was enshrined at the royal palace complex, which subsequently developed into the Sri Dalada Maligawa. 
							The countries most important Buddhist monasteries, Asgiriya and Malwatta, were also established in Kandy in 1753. From 1592 onwards Kandy, was 
							the last remaining independent kingdom in the Island since the coaster regions has been conquered by the Portuguese. The Portuguese as well 
							as the Dutch and British, between the 16th and 18th century, made many futile attempts to conquer the city but it remained a strong hold until 
							1815. In 1815 the Kandyan Convention was signed between the British and Kandyan aristocrats. This convention recognized the King of England 
							as the ruler of the Kingdom and Kandy became part of the British Empire.The last known King of Sri Lanka, Sri Wickerma Rajasighe, who was exiled 
							to South India by the British during the Colonial Era, is credited to have had the picture sake &#8220;Kandy Lake&#8221; built.</p>
							
						<p> In the period of World War II, Sri Lanka was a base for the allied forces and in 1944 the South East Asian Command of allies were known to have 
							moved the base to Kandy until the end of the war. In October 1947, the country gained Independence from the British and their on forth developed 
							under local democratic rule. The main structures, from homes to shops that still exist in the central business district of Kandy belong to 
							the times of British rule. Over the years the city has modified and modernized and evolved into what it is today. Due to the presence of 
							the Sri Dalada Maligawa as well as the cities other historical and cultural sites it can truly be deemed a unique and important city.</p>  </div>
