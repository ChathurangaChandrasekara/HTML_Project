						<h2> Knuckles mountain range </h2>
						<p>Knuckles mountain range is located within the district of Kandy in Sri 
          Lanka. Its appearance resembles a set of knuckles of a clenched fist. 
          With the highest point about 6,000 ft above sea level the Knuckles range 
          is a widespread region covering about 155 sq. km. A wide range of rare 
          and endemic flora and fauna makes this wilderness area a storehouse 
          of rich biodiversity.  </p>
		  
		  <p> Knuckles mountain range is located within the district of Kandy in Sri 
          Lanka. Its appearance resembles a set of knuckles of a clenched fist. 
          With the highest point about 6,000 ft above sea level the Knuckles range 
          is a widespread region covering about 155 sq. km. A wide range of rare 
          and endemic flora and fauna makes this wilderness area a storehouse 
          of rich biodiversity. There are 31 species of mammals recorded in the 
          Knuckles wilderness. The Knuckles range is also a semi evergreen forest. 
          The entire region is also unbelievably diverse in terms of climate and 
          terrain. You could easily trek through the dense forests. Panoramic 
          views of misty mountains, stunning valleys, ancient rock formations, 
          beautiful animal and plant life, and hospitable people make the Knuckles 
          range a must visit place in Sri Lanka. </p>
