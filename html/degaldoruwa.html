						<h2> The Degaldoruwa temple </h2>
						<p> The Degaldoruwa temple is situated in Amunugama a quaint little village 
          close to the Kandy Town. Built in 1771 AD by King Rajadi Rajasinha, 
          the Degaldoruwa Temple was initiated as a monastery during the time 
          of his brother King Kirti Sri Rajasinha. This cave temple is synonymous 
          with the Kandyan era and famous of its paintings and unique architecture. </p>
		  
		  <p> The Degaldoruwa temple is situated in Amunugama a quaint little village 
          close to the Kandy Town. Built in 1771 AD by King Rajadi Rajasinha, 
          the Degaldoruwa Temple was initiated as a monastery during the time 
          of his brother King Kirti Sri Rajasinha. This cave temple is synonymous

          </p>
		  
        <p>
          The temple has been constructed in a place where two large granite rocks, 
          soaring to about 40 feet, are facing each other and almost touching 
          below. A manmade cave has been buily by sheering the rocks, and this 
          cave accommodates a Shrine Room and a landing. Temple records point 
          out that the intricate paintings were the work of four painters. These 
          paintings are recognized as some of the best examples of the Kandyan 
          era paintings. Four &#8220;Jathaka Stories &quot; (stories of the reincarnations 
          of the Lord Buddha) are drawn at this cave temple of which one is the 
          famous Vessantara Jathaka story. They are the best paintings found in 
          Kandy other than Gangaramya. The wall paintings at Degaldoruwa differ 
          from many of other Kandiyan style paintings, the colors used and clothing 
          of the people depicted are unique to other paintings of the era.
