						<h2> Temple of the Tooth Relic </h2>
						<p>The Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy, the temple which houses the Sacred Tooth Relic of The Buddha, is possibly the most 
							sacred Buddhist shrine in the world. It is venerated not only by Buddhists in Sri Lanka but by Buddhists all over the world.King Wimaladharmasuriya 
							I (1592 - 1603), the first to select Kandy as the ruling capital originally built a two storied Temple for the Relic and brought the tooth relic 
							from Delgamuwa near Kuruwita in Sabaragamuwa which has been hidden for protection. Remains of this temple no longer exist. Wimaladharmasuriya 
							II (1686 - 1706) built a three storied temple and his son king Viraparakrama Narendrasinha (1706 - 1738), the last Sinhalese king to rule the country, 
							built a new two storied temple temple seeing that the old temple built by his father has decayed. The last king of Sri lanka, Sri Wickrama 
							Rajasinghe (1797 - 1814) built the Pattirippuwa (the Octagon). Originally, the Pattirippuwa (octagon) was part of the royal palace. It was used 
							by the king to address his follow countrymen. Today the Pattirippuwa has become a part of the temple and houses ancient textures written 
							in ola leaves. </p>
							
						<p>Located in Kandy, long a center of the Buddhist faith, the stunning 17th-century Temple of the Tooth (Sri Dalada Maligawa) 
							is believed to house the left upper canine tooth of the Lord Buddha himself. This precious relic attracts white-clad pilgrims, bearing lotus 
							blossoms and frangipani, every day.</p>

						<marquee direction="up" height="100% speed="5" onmousedown="this.stop();" onmouseup="this.start();">
							<p> According to legend, the tooth was taken from the Buddha as he lay on his funeral pyre. It was smuggled to Sri Lanka in 313 AD, hidden in 
							the hair of Princess Hemamali who fled the Hindu armies besieging her father's kingdom in India.</p>
							
						<p> It immediately became an object of great reverence and was enshrined in a series of nested jeweled reliquaries. The tooth was brought out 
							for special occasions and paraded on the backs of elephants, which are sacred to the Buddha. where it survived numerous attempts to capture and destroy it.</p>
							
						<p> When the capital was moved to Kandy, the tooth was taken to the new city and placed in temples built to honor it. The temple was originally 
							built under Kandyan kings between 1687 and 1707, but later severely damaged during the 18th-century colonial wars against the Portugese 
							and Dutch. After the wars, the original wooden structures were restored in stone.</p>
							
						<p> In January 1998 Hindu Tamil separatists bombed the temple, damaging its facade and roof. Restoration began immediately afterward.</p>
