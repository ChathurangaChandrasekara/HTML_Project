						<h2> Kandy Esala Perahera </h2>
						<p>	Kandy Esala Perahera is the grandest and colorful religious event in Sri Lanka. It is also one of the greatest events in Asia. The perahera 
							is 235 years aged which dates back to the reign of the king Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe (1747-1780). This is held annually in late July and early 
							August. Days are fixed by the Diyawadana Nilame of the Temple of the Tooth Relic. First there was only one perahera from the Temple of the 
							Tooth relic which was later merged with four perahera from four Devales.</p>
							
						<p>  Kandy Esala Perahera is the grandest and colorful religious event in Sri Lanka. It is also one of the greatest events in Asia. The perahera 
							is 235 years aged which dates back to the reign of the king Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe (1747-1780). This is held annually in late July and early 
							August. Days are fixed by the Diyawadana Nilame of the Temple of the Tooth Relic. First there was only one perahera from the Temple of the 
							Tooth relic which was later merged with four perahera from four Devales.</p>
		  
						<p> Perahera begins with the ceremony of &#8220;kap situweema&#8221; where cuttings from an esala tree are planted in four Devales. &#8220;Kumbal 
							Perahera&#8221; starts on the 6th day from kap planting. Throughout the night the perahera goes through the streets of Kandy. The Maligawa 
							perahera and other four Devalaya perahera always have the same order. The tusker of the Maligawa with the casket of the Tooth Relic on its 
							back heads the perahera followed by the Natha, Vishnu, Katharagama and Paththini Devales. The number of elephants is increased in each night 
							making the perahera grander. After five nights from Kumbal perahera it starts Randoli Perahera which goes for another five nights. The fifth 
							night is the grander day of the Perahera. On that night perahera goes through Dalada Veediya (Ward Street) and Trincomalee Street to the &#8220;Adhanamaluwa 
							Viharas&#8221;.</p>
		  
						<p> The water cutting ceremony that symbolizes the end of the festival is held before the dawn of the next day following the last perahera. This 
							is held in Mahaweli River near Gatambe by cutting the water with a sword. Then the final perahera parade through the street for the last time 
							of the year. The Perahera contains with lot of cultural items and also with beautifully dressed elephants. This is a great opportunity for 
							you to see all most all the cultural dances in Sri Lanka in one place. 
							You can watch this great pageant from anywhere along the route.</p>

							<p> According to legend, the tooth was taken from the Buddha as he lay on his funeral pyre. It was smuggled to Sri Lanka in 313 AD, hidden in 
							the hair of Princess Hemamali who fled the Hindu armies besieging her father's kingdom in India.</p>
							
						<p> It immediately became an object of great reverence and was enshrined in a series of nested jeweled reliquaries. The tooth was brought out 
							for special occasions and paraded on the backs of elephants, which are sacred to the Buddha. where it survived numerous attempts to capture and destroy it.</p>
							
						<p> When the capital was moved to Kandy, the tooth was taken to the new city and placed in temples built to honor it. The temple was originally 
							built under Kandyan kings between 1687 and 1707, but later severely damaged during the 18th-century colonial wars against the Portugese 
							and Dutch. After the wars, the original wooden structures were restored in stone.</p>
							
						<p> In January 1998 Hindu Tamil separatists bombed the temple, damaging its facade and roof. Restoration began immediately afterward.</p>
