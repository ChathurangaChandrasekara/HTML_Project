          was built during the 14th century by King Wickremabahu III in honour

          said to have beenon the invitation of his queen. The site comprises 
          the devale, digge and the centre where hewisi (sacred drums) were played.</p>
		  
        <p>
          The devalaya is predominantly an open air structure, consisting of elaborately 
          carved pillars and a wooden roof. The carved wooden pillars in the temple 
          are believed to have come from a royal audience hall in the city. The 
          artists of these carvings have been acclaimed for their work, as they 
          a noted as the finest of their kind belonging to the Kandyan era. The 
          intricate carvings include lions, swans, bulls, elephants, double-headed 
          eagles, leaf patterns, wrestling men, soldiers, and horse riders, dancing 
          women, mermaids and lotus motifs. 128 exceptional carvings adorn these 
          pillars and each and every one is different from the other. </p>
		  
        <p>
          There are eight buildings within the Devalaya premises. It is said that 
          King Vickremabhau had donated the door Frames and parts of his palace 
          to build this Devalaya. The doors in the devalaya have no hinges but 
          can be used like normal doors, portraying the architectural expertise 
          of the era. Among the items of historical value which belong to the 
          Devalaya are items presented by King Rajasinghe and by the Portuguese 
          and some items said to have been donated by the Ehelepola Adigar.A large 
          &#8220;Atuwa,&#8221; a structure that holds padi is also part of the 
          temple structure. </p>
